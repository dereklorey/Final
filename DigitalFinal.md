<h3>Tutorial on how to put together a PC:</h3>

**You will need the following items:**

1.) Motherboard (with north and southbridge)<br />
2.) A Processor (CPU) that matches the motherboard's socket <br />
3.) Random Access Memory (RAM) **Note: it's important to know what type of RAM your motherboard accepts such as DDR3, DDR4, or DDR5** <br />
4.) PCIe Slots on motherboard **Another note: The PCIe slot will act as the lowest generation between the video card and motherboard**<br />
5.) SATA 1.0, 2.0, or 3.0 attachments <br />
6.) USB ports 2.0 or 3.0, usually come on the motherboard or the tower<br />
7.) Data storage such as a hard drive or solid state drive <br />
8.) A video card (only if you're wanting to use it for gaming, otherwise one is in the motherboard)<br />
9.) Network interface controller (NIC) to connect to the wifi<br />
10.) Power Supply Unit (PSU) to power on everything else. The amount of wattage is determined by the hardware of everything else<br />
11.) Cooling unit (Water cooling or A fan) that matches your CPU socket<br />
12.) The case or tower, make sure it fits <br />
13.) Phillips/flathead screw driver <br />
**Optional:**<br />
1.) Needle nose plyers <br />
2.) Flashlight

<h4> Now for the actual building:</h4>

1.) place the power supply unit in the back of the computer case<br />
2.) Grab your motherboard and line the screw holes up with the risers on the computer case<br />
3.) Securely screw the motherboard and PSU in their places. <br />
**It is important to make sure the motherboard and PSU is secure**<br />
3.) Take the 24 pin connector from your Power supply and plug it into the motherboard <br />
4.) Next, take the EPS connector from the PSU and connect it to the EPS 12V socket. This will give the CPU enough power to run.<br />
5.) Now press the RAM into the RAM slot depending on what type your motherboard takes. **Make sure the RAM is clamped in place.**<br />
6.) Place the HDD or SDD into the designated area on your case. <br />
7.) Connect the SATA cable from the back of the storage unit to the SATA port on the motherboard<br />
8.) Now we're ready for the CPU to be installed. Place the CPU into the CPU socket on the motherboard. Once you have it in place, use the clamp connected to it to secure it<br />
**IMPORTANT: AMD and Intel processors are installed differently. AMD uses pins to clamp down and intel just plugs in and clamps with a metal protector, make sure your motherboard is compatible**<br />
9.) Your cooling unit will go directly on top of your processor. This is called a heatsink and will keep your CPU from overheating. There are 4 pin slots on your motherboard labeled CPU fan. Your CPU fans will go into these slots. (if you have multiple) <br />
10.) If you have your own video card, or GPU, you will securely press it into the PCIe slot on your motherboard. Then your power supply will need to be connected to it using the remaining pin connectors. <br />
11.) Do one last check to make sure everything is locked in and secure.<br />
12.) **Congratulations! you can now close your case!** <br />

<h4>Now it's time to set it up!</h4>

1.) Use the USB ports on the back of the case (where the motherboard is showing) and plug in your mouse and keyboard.
2.) Now, depending on the slots on your motherboard, plug your monitor in using the HDMI, VGA, or DVI slots.
3.) Plug your speakers into the audio jack on the back of the case.
4.) And finally plug the AC adapter into the power supply and then into the wall outlet.
